~~~ Description ~~~

Overcharge aims to separate the operation of energy weapons from their ballistic counterparts by introducing new mechanics built around a unified heat system. Energy weapons now behave as their own class, with performance and feedback driven by heat, charge, and sustained use. ﻿Every feature in Overcharge is built with compatibility and modularity in mind. They are all fully configurable globally, per weapon, and per ammo type. Systems can be enabled, disabled, or tuned to your personal taste, or load order. 

Listed below are some of the new features added by Overcharge:

- Scaling Stats: Weapon stats such as damage, fire rate, and accuracy dynamically change as you fire them
- Skill Level Matters: Your weapon skill affects how fast your weapons heat up and cool down.
- Overheating Weapons: Sustained firing builds heat, eventually forcing a temporary shutdown until the weapon cools and becomes usable again
- Overcharge Shot:  Holding the fire button charges a powerful projectile that is released upon letting go
- Charge Delay: Automatic weapons may have a short wind-up before they begin firing
- Color Modification: Colors of weapon geometry, projectiles, impacts, kill effects and more are recolored at the engine level, scaling dynamically with heat
- First Person Particles: Particles now work as you would expect in first person, flowing across the screen as you move the camera around
- Custom Sounds and Animations: New sounds and animations were made to be compatible, fun, as well as faithful to the original game's style
- Mesh Attachments: External meshes and particles can now be attached to weapons and can be configured to use a variety of effects
- NPC Integration: NPCs use and interact with the system, with balance tuned to both be fun to fight with and fight against.

~~~ Requirements ~~~

xNVSE (Version 6.42+)﻿
JIP NVSE﻿
kNVSE

~~~ Installation ~~~

Please install using a mod manager of your choice. I recommend Mod Organizer 2 (MO2).

~~~ Compatibility ~~~

First and foremost, EVE﻿ should should function with Overcharge, but it has not been explicitly configured or tested. Use it at your own discretion.

﻿While I don't generally use VFX mods, Special FX﻿ is fully compatible, and was used to take pretty screenshots for the images on this mod page. Any other VFX mod should also be compatible out of the box, and if they aren't I can try to create compatibility patches where needed. 

Making patches for Overcharge is intended to be straightforward. New weapons or weapon model replacers won't automatically align with the configuration I've packaged with this mod by default. Feel free to upload your own patches, otherwise I can try to accommodate where possible. 

For the purposes of this mod and future compatibility, I opted to use my attachment system, but if you are creating a new weapon or weapon model replacer and wish to integrate Overcharge, it is Strongly recommend that all attachments are pre placed directly in the .NIF before configuring them. 

~~~ Special Thanks ~~~

﻿This mod took a village (and a whole lot of time) to realize, so there are a lot of 'thank yous' to go around. Thank you to everyone who assisted in the creation of this mod, and if I forgot to mention you by name, please let me know. 

WallSoGB for helping tremendously with a lot of the coding and letting me pick his brains with all kinds of horrible bugs I couldn't have figured out on my own. 

PistolPayback﻿ who really played a key role in assisting me in the early stages of this mod. This mod wouldn't have gotten off the ground without you.﻿

Confused from xNVSE who saved me from a massive brick wall with the particle. Again, this mod would be dead in the water without you.

Balebandr0 for creating the mesh attachments for me and being supportive throughout. Thanks to you, this all looks a lot less ugly.

Stentorious for helping with the UI of this mod, I'm not even half the xml wizard you are.

DarianStephens﻿ who let me look at their scripted implementation of charge shots and was just all around helpful.

Hitman47101 for letting me use their rig to create the animations and helping out a ton in the animation department in general. 

StupidHead445 and ChadAmongMen for being the absolute best play testers and worst influences I could possibly ask for. 

To anyone else who helped in the testing of this mod.﻿
